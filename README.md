Daisy is the new Android browser from [Cliqz](https://cliqz.com/). Daisy is currently under development and _is not yet a production ready product!_

project, with extra Cliqz technologies integrated, namely:
 * Cliqz prototype search engine results page.
 * Anti-tracking, adblocker and other privacy tools.
 * Support for visiting p2p websites over the `dat://` protocol.
